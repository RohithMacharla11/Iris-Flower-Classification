# Iris-Flower-Classification

## Overview

This project is focused on classifying iris flowers using machine learning techniques. The iris flower dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and is often used for practicing classification algorithms.

## Introduction

The Iris Flower Classification project involves predicting the species of iris flowers based on their characteristics. It is a well-known introductory task in machine learning and is used to demonstrate the implementation of classification algorithms.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the famous Iris dataset, which is included in many machine learning libraries. It consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each belonging to one of three species: setosa, versicolor, or virginica.

## Features

The dataset includes the following features:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
